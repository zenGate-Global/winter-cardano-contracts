The Winter Protocol is designed to anchor a unique, evolving piece of data to the blockchain. This is achieved through a combination of two validators: a singleton minting policy to create a unique NFT that acts as an access token, and an object_event validator that governs the stateful UTXO holding the data and the singleton NFT.

<Alert variant="info" title="This system ensures that">
- A unique on-chain object can be created and identified.
- The object's associated data can be updated under strict, predefined rules.
- Only authorized parties (signers) can perform these actions.
- The entire system can be cleanly dismantled, burning the unique token.
