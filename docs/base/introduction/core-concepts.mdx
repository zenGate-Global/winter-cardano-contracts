## The Singleton Token

A key component of this protocol is a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT), referred to as the "singleton". This token is minted by the singleton validator and its uniqueness is guaranteed by consuming a specific, one-time-use UTXO (utxo_ref) during its creation.

The singleton token always resides within the object_event UTXO, acting as a key and ensuring that only one such stateful UTXO can exist for a given singleton.

## The Object Event UTXO

This is the main stateful UTXO of the protocol, locked by the object_event validator. It holds:

- The singleton token.
- The ObjectDatum, which contains the protocol's state.
- A minimum amount of lovelace.

## The Datum

The on-chain state is stored in the ObjectDatum. It has the following structure:

```aiken
pub type ObjectDatum {
  protocol_version: Int,
  data_reference: ByteArray,
  event_creation_info: Hash<Blake2b_256, Transaction>,
  signers: List<VerificationKeyHash>,
}
```
