## 1. singleton

This is a minting policy that controls the creation and destruction of the unique singleton token.

**Purpose:** To guarantee that only one token with a specific token_name can ever be minted.

**Redeemers:**

- **Mint:** Allows minting exactly one token. Requires a specific utxo_ref to be spent in the same transaction, ensuring one-time minting.
- **Burn:** Allows burning the token, which is required when the object_event UTXO is destroyed.

## 2. object_event

This validator script locks the stateful UTXO and enforces the core logic of the protocol.

**Purpose:** Manages the lifecycle of the on-chain object, handling its recreation (update) and destruction.

**Redeemers:**

- **RecreateEvent:** To update the ObjectDatum.
- **SpendEvent:** To destroy the contract state and burn the singleton.

### RecreateEvent Rules

This action allows updating the data_reference for error correction or other state changes.

- The transaction must be signed by at least one of the authorized signers from the datum.
- A new object_event UTXO must be created at the same script address.
- The singleton token must be passed from the old UTXO to the new one.
- The lovelace value in the new UTXO must be greater than or equal to the lovelace in the current UTXO.
- The ObjectDatum must be correctly preserved or updated:
  - protocol_version and signers must remain the same.
  - data_reference must be different (as this is the point of recreation).
  - event_creation_info must be preserved (or set to the initial transaction ID if it was previously empty).
- A protocol fee must be paid to a predefined address.

### SpendEvent Rules

This action allows the destruction of the on-chain object.

- The transaction must be signed by at least one of the authorized signers from the datum.
- The singleton token must be burned in the same transaction (amount = -1).
- A protocol fee must be paid to a predefined address.
