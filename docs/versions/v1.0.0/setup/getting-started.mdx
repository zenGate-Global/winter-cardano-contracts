## Prerequisites

<Alert variant="warning" title="Required">
You need to have the [Aiken compiler](https://aiken-lang.org/getting-started/installation) installed and configured on your system. This project is configured to use Aiken `v1.0.26-alpha`.
</Alert>

## Building

To compile the contracts, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
aiken build
```

<Alert variant="info">
This command type-checks the code and generates the compiled Plutus scripts and their metadata in the plutus.json file. This file is essential for building off-chain code and constructing transactions.
</Alert>

## Testing

Run as such:

```bash
aiken check
```

To run only tests matching a specific string, for example `foo`, use the `-m` flag:

```bash
aiken check -m foo
```
